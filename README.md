## TrainDelays
This repository contains the source code, data processing pipelines, and final report for a university "Big Data" project analyzing the reliability of the German railway system ("Deutsche Bahn").

The project analyzes over **60 million train arrival/departure records** from July 2024 to January 2026, correlating them with high-resolution geographical and weather data to identify patterns in delays and cancellations.

#### 📄 Project Artifacts
